    <p>Classic omlette recipe</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Eggs - we use large eggs, right out of the refrigerator. You`ll need 2 eggs to make 1 omelette.</li>
        <li>Salt - just a pinch of fine sea salt is plenty.</li>
        <li>Butter - you want to keep a well-buttered skillet for each omelette. Butter adds flavor and keeps the egg from sticking.</li>
        <li>Cheese - we love shredded mozzarella cheese (low moisture, part-skim), but you can use cheddar, Mexican cheese blend, Swiss, Monterey Jack, or your favorite cheese for omelettes.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparing</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Beat eggs</b> - in a small bowl, combine 2 eggs and a pinch of salt, then beat with a fork or whisk until frothy.</li>
        <li><b>Heat skillet</b> - place a small non-stick pan over medium heat and melt in 1/2 Tbsp of butter. Once butter is melted and bubbly, pour in the egg mixture and reduce heat to low.</li>
        <li><b>Pull cooked eggs</b> with a spatula into the center, allowing the liquid eggs to fill in the space.</li>
        <li><b>Flip</b> - once eggs are nearly set, the omelette slides easily on the skillet and you can get a spatula underneath, flip it over. Turn off the heat.</li>
        <li><b>Fold</b> - add cheese and your favorite toppings, fold the omelet, and slide it onto a plate to serve.</li>
    </ol>
