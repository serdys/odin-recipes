    <h3>Preparing</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the lasagna noodles and cook

        <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet or Dutch oven, brown the beef, sausage, onion, and garlic over medium-high

        <li>Stir in the pasta sauce, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, ½ teaspoon of salt, and ¼ teaspoon of black
            pepper. Simmer uncovered over medium heat for 5 minutes or until slightly thickened. Taste and season with

            and ¼ teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Spread 1 cup of the meat sauce in a 9×13 pan or casserole dish. Top it with 3 lasagna noodles. Layer with ⅓
            of the ricotta cheese mixture and 1 cup of meat sauce. Repeat twice more. Finish with 3 noodles topped with
            remaining sauce.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes. </li>
        <li>Remove the foil and sprinkle the top of the lasagna with the remaining 2 ½ cups mozzarella cheese and ¼ cup
            parmesan cheese. Bake uncovered for an additional 15 minutes or until browned and bubbly. Broil for 2-3
            minutes if desired.</li>
